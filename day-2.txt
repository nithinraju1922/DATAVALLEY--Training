if else:
if the condition is false then the set of statements inside the if condition is not executed for that we can simply use else to getting output.
LOOPS:
for loop,while loop,do-while loop.
Entry controlled loop:while loop.
Exit controlled loop:do while loop.
while loop examples:
cubes,find sum of number,prime numbers,lcm,gcd,amazon .
do while loop exapmles:
when you know ni=umber of iterations ex:amazon ads,

nested for loops:
PATTERNS:
simple logics to remember:
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
for triangle
j<=i
methods():
without parameters and with parameters:
withparameters:
method(parameters);->actual parameters;
while calling method we must to pass formal parameters
