why static is used in main method?
JVM first checks main method in the program,then whenever we use static keyword no need to create object for that class.
static key word is used to stop object creation
Non static class or method must need to create object to execute the program.
Here object creation is allowed only for classes.
If we create object for methods then it throws errors.
