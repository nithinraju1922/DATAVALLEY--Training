CORE JAVA:
difference between core java and java.
core java:
it is used to build business applications and web applications.
java:
it is used for programming.
reason for partial oop concept is wrapping class.
OOP 4 PILLERS.
1.polymorphism:
many forms.
ex:student in different locations.
i.runtime polymorphism or method overloading:same name with multiple parameters.
ii.compile time polymorphism or method overriding:
2.Inheritence.
extract properties from parents to child.
in java multiple inheritance is not supported for that interface is introduced.
I.single Inheritence:
in java there is only one public class for main class.
always child class is main class and main method write here only.
y inheritance:
using of existing function and create new functionality.
II.multilevel
III. Hierarchy inheritence:
combination of both single and multilevel inheritance .
ii.Method overriding:
3.Encapsulation.
to prevent the direct access for the variables by using getter and setter.

Abstraction:
hide the unnecessary data.
it is used for security reasons
here method declaration is only allowed.concrete method
OS.
windows:userinterface
Linux:only commands,it has more security.
DBMS:
db creation:create database ;
to show db:show db;
table create:create table tablename;
to see table structure:desc tablename;
insert:insert into table name.
select *from tablename;
update,set,alter:it is used to adding new colomun

in SQL we build tables,here joins are used to access the data.
in mangodb we build pipes,no need joins to access the data.
relational:stored in tables and interlinked with eachother by using joins
non-relational:stored
